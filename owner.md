# About me

Hey, I'm Gyula NÃ©meth (GYN), the owner of your dream apartment.

![Me](/me.png)

I lived in this apartment for 15+ years. The building was built a year before I moved in. It was really close to my university, and actually a lot of unis are nearby.

This apartment is close enough to the downtown, so you can enjoy everything in Budapest, but it's far enough from the downtown, so the area is not touristic, but you have everything you need. The area is optimized for locals!

I really loved in the apartment that it's very, very quiet, because of the view to the park. There is one catch though... you might wake up because of some tweeting birds if you keep your window open. :wink:

By this time, you might have realized that I love my apartment, so keep in mind:

If you destroy my apartment, I'm gonna destroy you! :wink:
